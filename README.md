This repository contains the implementation for the ACM AISec '23 paper [Equivariant Differentially Private Deep Learning: Why DP-SGD Needs Sparser Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3605764.3623902).

## Installation
We recommend [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) to manage packages. You can create an environment and install all necessary packages with:

```bash
mamba env create -n <env-name> -f requirements.yml
```

Requires Python 3.8+ and CUDA 11.7 (or another compatible version).

## Quick reproduction

There are `config` files available to reproduce the results from the paper. E.g. the Equivariant ResNet-9 on CIFAR100 with a $(\varepsilon = 2, \delta = 10^{-5})$-DP can be run with:

```bash
python train.py setup=eqresnet9-cifar100 setup.dp.target_epsilon=2 setup.dp.target_delta=1e-5
```
