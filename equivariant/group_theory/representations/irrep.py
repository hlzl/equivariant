        Describes an "*irreducible representation*" (*irrep*).
        It is a subclass of a :class:`~Representation`.

        Irreducible representations are the building blocks into which any other representation decomposes under a
        change of basis.
        Indeed, any :class:`~Representation` is internally decomposed into a direct sum of irreps.

        Args:
            group (group_theory.Group): the group which is being represented
            id (tuple): args to generate this irrep using ``group.irrep(*id)``
            name (str): an identification name for this representation
            representation (dict or callable): a callable implementing this representation or a dict mapping
                    each group element to its representation.
            size (int): the size of the vector space where this representation is defined (i.e. the size of the matrices)
            type (str): type of the irrep. It needs to be one of `R`, `C` or `H`, which represent respectively
                        real, complex and quaternionic types.
                        NOTE: this parameter substitutes the old `sum_of_squares_constituents` from *e2cnn*.
            supported_nonlinearities (list): list of nonlinearitiy types supported by this representation.
            character (callable or dict, optional): a callable returning the character of this representation for an
                    input element or a dict mapping each group element to its character.
            **kwargs: custom attributes the user can set and, then, access from the dictionary
                    in :attr:`Representation.attributes`

        Attributes:
            ~.id (tuple): tuple which identifies this irrep; it can be used to generate this irrep as ``group.irrep(*id)``
            ~.sum_of_squares_constituents (int): the sum of the squares of the multiplicities of pairwise distinct
                    irreducible constituents of the character of this representation over a non-splitting field (see
                    `Character Orthogonality Theorem <https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Character_orthogonality_theorem#Statement_over_general_fields_in_terms_of_inner_product_of_class_functions>`_
                    over general fields).
                    This attribute is fully determined by the irrep's `type` as:
