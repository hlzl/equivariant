        Abstract class for bases implementing a :math:`G`-steerable basis for *scalar* filters over an Euclidean space
        :math:`\R^n`.
        The action of ``G`` on the Euclidean space is given by the :class:`~Representation` ``action``.
        The dimensionality of the Euclidean space is inferred by the size of the ``action``.
        A :math:`G`-steerable basis provides an irreps-decomposition of the action of :math:`G` on the vector space of
        square-integrable functions, i.e. :math:`L^2(\R^n)`.
        The input list ``js`` defines the order and the multiplicity of the ``G``-irreps in this decomposition.
        More precisely, ``js`` is a list of tuples ``(irrep_id, multiplicity)``, where ``irrep_id`` is the ``id`` of
        an :class:`~IrreducibleRepresentation`.
        The order of the basis elements sampled in :meth:`~SteerableFiltersBasis.sample` should be
        consistent with the order of the irreps in the list ``js``.
        Since this class only parameterizes scalar filters, ``SteerableFiltersBasis.shape = (1, 1)``.
        Args:
            G (Group): the symmetry group
            action (Representation): the representation of the action of ``G`` on the Euclidean space
            js (list): the multiplicity of each irrep in this basis.
        Attributes:
            ~.G (Group): the symmetry group
            ~.action (Representation): the representation of the action of ``G`` on the Euclidean space
            ~.js (list): the multiplicity of each irrep in this basis.
